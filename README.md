makesite.py
===========

Forked from [Sunaina Pai's makesite](https://github.com/sunainapai/makesite)
and customized/extended to suit my needs.

This script is what builds [my website](https://fietkau.me/) in its entirety.
This code is highly specific to the sections and contents I use and I expect
that not very much of it will be useful to other people. Nonetheless, since the
original project is MIT licensed, I'll keep that going and offer my modified
code under MIT as well.
